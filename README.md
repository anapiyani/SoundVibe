# Spotify Clone using React + Spotify API
Just a simple web music player created using React + Spotify API. You can search for millions of songs, get information about tracks or albums, and learn about artists. Additionally, you can like songs and listen to them on the 'liked' page. The app is optimized for speed and simplicity. It's version 0.0.2, so there may be some issues that I'll fix soon.


## Features
1. Search: Easily find millions of songs, albums, and artists using the search functionality.
2. Song Information: Get detailed information about each track, including title, artist, album, and more.
3. Album Details: Explore album details such as tracklist, release date, and cover art.
4. Like Songs: Save your favorite songs by liking them, making them easily accessible for future listening.
